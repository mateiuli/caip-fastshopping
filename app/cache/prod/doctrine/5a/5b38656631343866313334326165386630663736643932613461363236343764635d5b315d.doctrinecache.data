When we detect suspicious activity before, during, or after an order is placed, it is reflected in the order\u2019s EQ8 score. An order with a low score is most likely fraudulent, and depending on how low the score is, it is held or flagged for manual review. When an order\u2019s score is low enough to be suspicious, but not low enough for the store administrator to confidently cancel the order, NS8 Compete Storefront Protection provides the tools to escalate the order and request e-mail and SMS text verification from the user. If the user verifies their phone number, the store administrator can process the order with confidence.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Revenue Killer #2: Advertising Fraud\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><div>Advertising fraud (especially remarketing fraud) is a huge and growing issue for online merchants. Up to 34% of online advertising campaign budgets are stolen using fraudulent traffic. NS8 Complete Storefront Protection not only scores all of the traffic visiting your store, but it also detects and records the traffic\u2019s source. You will see when, and which, advertising campaigns are delivering low-quality, high-risk, fraudulent traffic. You will be able to save money and increase revenue by eliminating poorly performing campaigns and focusing your budget on the successful campaigns that deliver results.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Revenue Killer #3: Poor Performance\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><div>NS8 Complete Storefront Protection includes five critical monitors that every PrestaShop store should have to ensure their store\u2019s performance and customer experience. These include the monitoring of SSL certificates, being added to a spam list, getting flagged for malware, store pages failing to load correctly, and any drop in performance against the global average of online stores.
