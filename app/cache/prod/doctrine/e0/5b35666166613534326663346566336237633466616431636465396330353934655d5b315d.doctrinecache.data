When we detect suspicious activity before, during, or after an order is placed, it is reflected in the order\u2019s EQ8 score. An order with a low score is most likely fraudulent, and depending on how low the score is, it is held or flagged for manual review. When an order\u2019s score is low enough to be suspicious, but not low enough for the store administrator to confidently cancel the order, NS8 Compete Storefront Protection provides the tools to escalate the order and request e-mail and SMS text verification from the user. If the user verifies their phone number, the store administrator can process the order with confidence.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Revenue Killer #2: Advertising Fraud\u00a0<\/strong><\/div><div>Advertising fraud (especially remarketing fraud) is a huge and growing issue for online merchants.
